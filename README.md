# Local Restaurant Directory

Thank you for checking out my project. 

Using the wxWidget libray I was able to make a GUI for creating a directory for restaunts
where I have linked the menu and given a recommended dish for the restraunt. Restaunts are broken into
categories and subcategories. Categories consist of the nationality of the foods orgin and the subcategories
are the region where that cusine comes from or the general food category it is generalized as.

When launching the application please have the .exe file launch from the folder with the .cpp and .h files
otherwise the window will pop up saying it doesnt see the txt files in the resource folder and ask you to quit.
